# Translations

Translations are stored in [src/i18n/translations](https://github.com/etcaterva/eas-frontend/tree/master/src/i18n/translations)

We are using [i18n-editor](https://github.com/jcbvm/i18n-editor) to edit our translations as it does what we need and it's free.

1. Download and install i18n-editor
2. Once it's open, go to `File` -> `Import project...` and choose the `src/i18n/translations` folder
3. Make your changes and save them
4. Commit the changes

\*Note: translations are not picked up from the project, you have to at least add the keys to one of the languages for it to be shown in i18n-editor.
